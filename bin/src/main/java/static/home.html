<!--Recall that HTML uses tags to specify content. The root tag of any HTML document is "html". By "root" tag, I simply mean that it is the outermost tag in the document that encompasses all other tags.

NOTE: There are opening and closing tags. Most tags are required to be closed. Closing tags start with the "/" symbol.-->
